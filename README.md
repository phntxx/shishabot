# shishabot

shishabot is a simple little discord bot that records all the people it ever interacted with, then sends them a given message in a random interval.
this project was started as a joke bot that would just ask you "do you want to smoke shisha / hookah with me?", that's also why there are message options for
"yes" and "no".

# getting started

to get shishabot up and running, simply populate [the settings file](https://github.com/phntxx/shishabot/blob/master/conf/settings.json) and use the given 
docker-compose file, making sure that shishabot has `/usr/src/app/conf` pointing to the directory where the `settings.json` file is located.
